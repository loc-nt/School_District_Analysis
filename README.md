## Analysis reports

After removing the scores for all 9th grade students in Thomas High School, the results have changed significantly in most of the summary reports.

In the District Summary, the average math score and reading score almost do not change at all (average math goes up by 0.1, and average reading stays the same). However, the percentages of passing students go down by 1.1 %, 1.3%, and 0.9% on math, reading, overall respectively.

In the School Summary, this does not look good for Thomas High School. The school drops out of the top 5 highest performance school (down to 8th rank). Even though the average scores stay relatively the same, all of the passing rates in math, reading, and overall go down significantly from 93$, 97%, 91% to 67%, 73%, 65%, respectively. The reason is that since the 9th grade scores are removed, all their test results are considered failed. This will resolved once we have the correct scores updated.

In term of other summmary reports, since Thomas High School is a medium-sized Charter Type and falls under $630-$644 range of capita, only numbers in those categories are being affected. Firstly, the average scores for both math and reading stays relatively unchanged for the 9th grade in general. Secondly, all the passing rates go down (math 73% to 67%, reading 84% to 78%, overall 63% to 56%) for this range of spending budget per student. Similarly, all the passing rates for medium size schools also decrease (math 94% to 88%, reading 97% to 91%, overall 91% to 85%), Lastly, the Charter schools also suffer from the passing rates drops (math 94% to 90%, reading 97% to 93%, overall 90% to 87%).
